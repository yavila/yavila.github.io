      <description>Circle Central Circles, or rather ellipses, are much harder to do properly than lines. I keep wanting to rely on my wrist instead of my arm to control the motion. I did the circle inside the plane exercise near the end, and I feel that my circles had improved by that point. It took me about an hour to do this exercise. Who knew drawing circles could take so long?</description>

      <description>Humble Beginnings I drew a little bit of anime as a kid (as most nerds do at one point or another) and found it to be pretty fun &amp;ndash; so I thought, what the heck maybe I can do drawing more seriously. It&amp;rsquo;s relaxing and it&amp;rsquo;s something I can do to wind down at the end of the day. Plus, if I stick with it, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually, hopefully be able to draw something I&amp;rsquo;m proud of.</description>
